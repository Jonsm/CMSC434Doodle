##How to use
Hold down to draw. Use the x icon at the top left to clear your drawing. You can select brush size with the 3 circle icons near the top middle.

Change color by clicking the square at the top right. Use the RGBA sliders to adjust color and transparency.

Finally, if you select "Rainbow mode", the brush will change color as you draw, looking like a rainbow.

I used stackoverflow.com and pcsalt.com for help with dynamically changing icon color, and adding custom XML to popup windows and action bars.
